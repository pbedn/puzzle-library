"""
 You are given a list of integers. Your task in this mission is to find,
 how many times the sorting direction was changed in the given list.
 If the elements are equal - the previous sorting direction remains the same,
 if the sequence starts from the same elements - look for the next different to determine the sorting direction.

 There are three sorting directions:

    on the chunk 1, 2, 2 - up (increasing);
    on the chunk 2, 1 - down (decreasing);
    and on the chunk 1, 2, 2 - up again.

So, you have two points of changing the sorting direction: #1 - from up to down,
and #2 - from down to up. That's the result your function should return.

Input: A list of integers.

Output: Integer.

Preconditions:
    the list is non-empty;
    the elements are positive integers.
