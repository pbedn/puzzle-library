"""
For language training our Robots want to learn about suffixes.

In this task, you are given a set of words in lower case. Check whether there is a pair of words, such that one word is the end of another (a suffix of another). For example: {"hi", "hello", "lo"} -- "lo" is the end of "hello", so the result is True.

Input: Words as a set of strings.

Output: True or False, as a boolean.

Precondition: 2 â‰¤ len(words) < 30
all(re.match(r"\A[a-z]{1,99}\Z", w) for w in words)
