"""
Your mission is to convert the name of a function (a string) from the Python format (for example "my_function_name") into CamelCase ("MyFunctionName"), where the first char of every word is in uppercase and all words are concatenated without any intervening characters.

Input: A function name as a string.

Output: The same string, but in CamelCase.

Precondition:
0 < len(string) <= 100
Input data won't contain any numbers.
